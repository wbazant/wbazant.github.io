This is going to be a blog with mostly pieces of programming knowledge but I might post my banana pancake recipe here, too. I'll try to keep the posts light on opinion and not be too wrong, there will be bias but mostly through selection of topics.

At some point there will be links to sites you might enjoy, a comments section, an analytics tracker that tells me how you've moved your eyeballs over my posts, and more!
