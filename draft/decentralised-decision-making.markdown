title: Decentralised decision making

# Introduction

Getting people to cooperate with the would-be decision maker is not easy. Dear reader, I know you wouldn't go as low as various self-proclaimed kings and emperors of the past did, and I trust you will eschew cooperation strategies based on violence or convincing others that you're special and worth obeying. If so, this guide is for you!

# What free individuals are usually aware of
## One can do what they want

I think any guide on decision making needs to start from the fundamental observation that anyone can do what they want, even though they might not like the choices they have, or some consequences of their actions.

## Everyone's needs can be met
People have all kinds of needs, and sometimes they are in an apparent conflict - e.g. my desire for free expression, and your desire to not read drivel. I believe any such conflict can be resolved by reframing it, considering more solutions, or obtaining more of a resource, e.g. if you want to read better stuff, you could give me some writing tips, I will very much appreciate them!

Just because other people have needs, it doesn't mean you have to help them meet them, but you can and in fact it feels super cool when you manage to.

## Other people's decisions influence the outcomes of your choices
There's a framework of cooperative game theory where all players each choose among options given to them, and then payoffs happen based on what everyone did. For any such game, there's an outcome that's best for everyone collectively, as well as the most stable outcome - the famous Nash equilibrium, where no one player can improve their outcome by acting differently. The big learning is that what's going to happen really depends on the game. This is a good illustration if you haven't seen it yet:
