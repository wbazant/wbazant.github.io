        <p>Sometimes the programs you are running aren&#39;t as fully featured as you need them to be. If it&#39;s your program, extend it to do work like you want it, the ad-hoc extensions will make it soon feel like a warm worn-in shoe. If it&#39;s not your program, and the missing feature is correctness, just fix your copy, and submit the fix to the author. Otherwise add the extra functionality outside, with an appropriate contraption. Here&#39;s a couple from me, based around pipes. </p>

        <p>There is a belief, especially popular under university graduates with heads full of Noam Chomsky, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy">in the inherent hierarchy of grammars</a>, and there are people out there who think it&#39;s something that has to be followed. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454">Obey the hierarchy, they tell you</a>. I suggest you hear them out, learn what is there to be learned, and then reply, I didn&#39;t know there were any rules about this. Dear reader, you are my fellow human and I want you to be strong and empowered. I&#39;m gonna show you how to parse XML with regular expressions, and then you can make your own choices.</p>

        <p>The usual way to control a script&#39;s behaviour is to provide a config file or command line arguments at startup. Actually, it&#39;s also common to modify the script&#39;s code, typically after executing it and noticing it&#39;s not doing the right thing. Neither of these are very convenient when you are including the script somewhere else. This post is about the third way, its curious advantages, and how it&#39;s usually epically bad but sometimes it isn&#39;t.</p>

        <p>An externally facing application is tested before delivery to assure it meets expectations placed in it. <a href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/10/04/CodeIsNotTheAnswer.html">Uncle Bob is sternly clear that you&#39;re really not doing a good job if you don&#39;t have an automated means of doing that</a>. This of course assumes you care about the expectations people place in your software, but (even outside the commercial setting where people try to get others to pay for their work) disputing that assumption is only allowed in what my friend calls a &quot;philosophical free-for-all&quot; - perhaps you are the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/rothko-red-on-maroon-t01168">Rothko</a> of coders demonstrating that software having to do something is just another assumption to be challenged, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaGxhpe1NZ4">another V the cloaked renegade</a> directing an orchestra of humming fans and creaking CPUs.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re employed on a large software development project, you gotta write tests, maybe even before you write the code, and then you gotta submit pull requests, and there will be tools checking that you wrote enough tests, and that they pass. In a less hip but equally large environment, like a bank, you still you gotta run tests, and e.g. attach their results in a spreadsheet. </p>

<p>At Expression Atlas, I did some work on the experiment import pipeline. I could choose how many tests to write, and it wasn&#39;t typical to write tests, but I believe it&#39;s quite neat that I did. </p>

        <p>There is a big idea out there in the startup world that you should build a Minimum Viable Product, e.g. <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">The Lean Startup tells you to do that</a>. The general principle is to put together an unpolished product that is the core of your idea, presumably get someone to use it, and iterate from there. This is sometimes confused with a prototype or a demo that you put together and show to investors, or only manifests itself with the founders&#39; idea that they need to build something. </p>

<p>Surprisingly, I have encountered very similar strategies during my short but thrilling early career in an investment bank. As teams tried to navigate the complex landscape of random requirements, unclear priorities - my boss&#39;s boss&#39;s boss actually ordained during a yearly town hall that we should be prioritising stability while delivering on new features - and random interruptions of &quot;we can&#39;t deploy software because there&#39;s gonna be an announcement by a central bank and lots of trading&quot; or &quot;we can&#39;t hire anyone this quarter, because we didn&#39;t make enough money in Japan&quot; - anyway, I&#39;m rambling. People still got stuff done, thanks to the MVP principle: do most of what you have to do with the limited means available to you, i.e. the minimum viable effort that still gets you a promotion. I will share a couple of examples: may you find them educative and inspiring.</p>

        <p>Welcome to my blog! The posts are shamelessly backdated, including this one. I originally wanted to make this around late 2016, wrote some drafts, forgot about it for a while, and the initial publication was mid-2018. Since then, it&#39;s been a roaring success, and as of last week I can say I&#39;m negotiating a book deal.</p>

<p>It&#39;s going to be mostly about programming but I might post my banana pancake recipe here, too. And of course it&#39;s not all gonna be lies but there will be some lies.</p>
