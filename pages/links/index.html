<h2>Personal pages and blogs</h2>

<p>Imagine the Internet based around content created on a voluntary basis: the equivalent of a social network would be people&#39;s personal sites linking to stuff they want others to see. Everyone would, apart from a place for themselves, have a place for their favourite friends and strangers. What if I told you that you can go there.</p>

<h2>Noteable bloggers I&#39;ve met</h2>

<h3><a href="http://baatz.io/">Carl Baatz</a></h3>

<p>I wanted to work for the guy when I tried to become a Haskell programmer.  He came to Oxford&#39;s job fair and advertised his startup, just at a bare desk with plain printouts. I got to an interview- with, incidentally, <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/">this guy</a> - didn&#39;t do quite well enough, was given an option to contact them in half a year if I learn some more, but something else happened. Carl has really good thoughts, the blog is prescriptive in nature - I think you should live your life like this - and original. Go read the one where he explains why an out of place object, like a cottage in a like, is bad art. </p>

<h3><a href="https://zhiganglu.com/">Zhigang, a bioinformatician by day web developer by night</a></h3>

<p>I worked with Zhigang and I was googling his paper. It turns out he likes web development as a hobby, sometimes wants to do it in his spare time, and has a fun personal page.</p>

<h3><a href="https://micans.org/stijn/">Stijn, a nice guy and really good at Go</a></h3>

<p>Very good home page. I also recommend MCL, a clustering algorithm he discovered.</p>

<h2>Bloggers I only know from the Internet</h2>

<h3><a href="https://moxie.org/">Moxie Marlinspike</a></h3>

<p>My favourite anarchist, sailor, cryptographer, and the creator of <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> </p>

<h3><a href="http://shii.bibanon.org/shii.org/knows/Everything_Shii_Knows.html">Everything Shii knows</a></h3>

<p>I don&#39;t know who Shii is, but they decided to make a wiki page about every interest and piece of knowledge of theirs, presumably because they want others to know it too. Very decentralised in spirit, much like Internet should be. </p>

<h1>Command line utilities</h1>

<p>You don&#39;t really need to code to use these, you just have to like reading text instead of looking at pictures.</p>

<h2>Youtube</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mps-youtube/mps-youtube">Command line youtube client</a>
Excellent, because the search results are clear and nice, there&#39;s a history of stuff I listened to, no recommendations, and <em>no ads</em>. Everything else works: videos play if you want to, summaries of search results can be accessed, probably comments too but I wasn&#39;t really missing them so I haven&#39;t verified.</p>

<h2>Facebook</h2>

<p>There is <a href="https://github.com/specious/facebook-cli">a command line client</a>, but it&#39;s limited to what an app accessing your facebook can do (actually when logging in you create your own app and give it permissions to your account). Has lists of all photos, friends, and events in your calendar (so you could maybe export them to a different calendar) but doesn&#39;t let you do much.
If you want bulk access to your Facebook data, they let you download it, then you can pack it up in a folder, delete the whole thing, and come back to your data when you get nostalgic about our society&#39;s &quot;Everyone&#39;s on Facebook&quot; days.</p>

<h2><a href="https://asciinema.org">Asciinema</a></h2>

<p>Lets you record stuff you do on command line. &quot;Start&quot;, &quot;stop&quot;, then you can watch a replay.</p>

<h1>Tales</h1>

<h2>Story from a video game</h2>

<p><a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Quotes/PlanescapeTorment">source</a>
 An elderly man was sitting alone on a dark path, right? He wasn&#39;t certain of which direction to go, and he&#39;d forgotten both where he was traveling to and who he was. He&#39;d sat down for a moment to rest his weary legs, and suddenly looked up to see an elderly woman before him. She grinned toothlessly and with a cackle, spoke: &#39;Now your third wish. What will it be?&#39;
&#39;Third wish?&#39; The man was baffled. &#39;How can it be a third wish if I haven&#39;t had a first and second wish?&#39;
&#39;You&#39;ve had two wishes already,&#39; the hag said, &#39;but your second wish was for me to return everything to the way it was before you had made your first wish. That&#39;s why you remember nothing; because everything is the way it was before you made any wishes.&#39; She cackled at the poor berk. &#39;So it is that you have one wish left.&#39;
&#39;All right,&#39; said the man, &#39;I don&#39;t believe this, but there&#39;s no harm in wishing. I wish to know who I am.&#39;
&#39;Funny,&#39; said the old woman as she granted his wish and disappeared forever. &#39;That was your first wish.&#39;</p>

<h2>The criminal-catching robot</h2>

<p><a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2017-03/msg00171.html">Source</a>
Once upon a time, a man with a dirty lab coat and long, uncombed hair
showed up at the town police station, demanding to see the chief of
police.  &quot;I&#39;ve done it!&quot; he exclaimed.  &quot;I&#39;ve built the perfect
criminal-catching robot!&quot;</p>

<p>The police chief was skeptical, but decided that it might be worth
the time to see what the man had invented.  Also, he secretly thought,
it might be a somewhat unwise move to completely alienate the mad
scientist and his army of hunter robots.</p>

<p>So, the man explained to the police chief how his invention could tell
the difference between a criminal and law-abiding citizen using a
series of heuristics.  &quot;It&#39;s especially good at spotting recently
escaped prisoners!&quot; he said.  &quot;Guaranteed non-lethal restraints!&quot;</p>

<p>Frowning and increasingly skeptical, the police chief nevertheless
allowed the man to demonstrate one robot for a week.  They decided that
the robot should patrol around the jail.  Sure enough, there was a
jailbreak a few days later, and an inmate digging up through the
ground outside of the prison facility was grabbed by the robot and
carried back inside the prison.</p>

<p>The surprised police chief allowed the robot to patrol a wider area.
The next day, the chief received an angry call from the zookeeper.
It seems the robot had cut through the bars of one of the animal cages,
grabbed the animal, and delivered it to the prison.</p>

<p>The chief confronted the robot&#39;s inventor, who asked what animal it
was.  &quot;A zebra,&quot; replied the police chief.  The man slapped his head and
exclaimed, &quot;Curses!  It was fooled by the black and white stripes!
I shall have to recalibrate!&quot;  And so the man set about rewriting the
robot&#39;s code.  Black and white stripes would indicate an escaped
inmate UNLESS the inmate had more than two legs.  Then it should be
left alone.</p>

<p>The robot was redeployed with the updated code, and seemed to be
operating well enough for a few days.  Then on Saturday, a mob of
children in soccer clothing, followed by their parents, descended
on the police station.  After the chaos subsided, the chief was told
that the robot had absconded with the referee right in the middle of
a soccer game.</p>

<p>Scowling, the chief reported this to the scientist, who performed a
second calibration.  Black and white stripes would indicate an escaped
inmate UNLESS the inmate had more than two legs OR had a whistle on
a necklace.</p>

<p>Despite the second calibration, the police chief declared that the robot
would no longer be allowed to operate in his town.  However, the news
of the robot had spread, and requests from many larger cities were
pouring in.  The inventor made dozens more robots, and shipped them off
to eager police stations around the nation.  Every time a robot grabbed
something that wasn&#39;t an escaped inmate, the scientist was consulted,
and the robot was recalibrated.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the inventor was just one man, and he didn&#39;t have the
time or the resources to recalibrate EVERY robot whenever one of them
went awry.  The robot in Shangri-La was recalibrated not to grab a
grave-digger working on a cold winter night while wearing a ski mask,
and the robot in Xanadu was recalibrated not to capture a black and
white television set that showed a movie about a prison break, and so
on.  But the robot in Xanadu would still grab grave-diggers with ski
masks (which it turns out was not common due to Xanadu&#39;s warmer climate),
and the robot in Shangri-La was still a menace to old televisions (of
which there were very few, the people of Shangri-La being on the average
more wealthy than those of Xanadu).</p>

<p>So, after a few years, there were different revisions of the
criminal-catching robot in most of the major cities.  In some places,
a clever criminal could avoid capture by wearing a whistle on a string
around the neck.  In others, one would be well-advised not to wear orange
clothing in certain rural areas, no matter how close to the Harvest
Festival it was, unless one also wore the traditional black triangular
eye-paint of the Pumpkin King.</p>

<p>Many people thought, &quot;This is lunacy!&quot;  But others thought the robots
did more good than harm, all things considered, and so in some places
the robots are used, while in other places they are shunned.</p>
