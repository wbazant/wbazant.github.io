### I offer services involving processing text, automation, and organizing data.

#####  I can help you with: 
- data held in maps / websites / PDFs that you would rather have in a single spreadsheet
- a manual computer task that you repeat a lot
- information you can't process, because there's too much of it to look at

<p> Here's my email address: <br> 
<a href="#">
<script type="text/javascript">
  var x = ".bazant@";
  document.write('wojciech' + x + 'gmail.com');
</script>
</a>

#### What can I do?
I have spent a lot of my time learning the kind of programming that was interesting to me, particularly Perl and UNIX. I ended up with a skill set that lets me retrieve information from various sources, transform it however is needed, and put it in convenient formats.

I can currently do quite a few things. Anything you think a computer should be able to do for you, I might be able to implement. Same if you are considering paying someone to just sit and click for a long time - I have done successful work for people who weren't initially looking for an automated solution.

For one off tasks, I will just send you the results and the program. For something you will need regularly, I can also work with you to integrate the automation into your workflow.

#### Thinking I might be a good fit for your startup?
There are many exciting areas of technology, like augmented reality, and many traditional businesses, like real estate lending, that can be a great opportunity for someone with a good idea. It is a long journey from the idea to its implementation: turning that initial spark into specification, then a product, then searching for the market for it. I would be happy to provide services to you - we can work out a contract or a consultancy agreement - but I am not ready to become a CTO of a company just yet. So if you are not looking for a CTO, please do write to me!
