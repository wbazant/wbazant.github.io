    <section id="section-1"><p>The Atlas webapp code has <a href="https://github.com/gxa/atlas/blob/master/base/src/main/java/uk/ac/ebi/atlas/commons/streams/ObjectInputStream.java">this interface</a> :</p>

<pre><code>import java.io.Closeable;

public interface ObjectInputStream&lt;T&gt; extends Closeable {
    // returns null when stream is empty
    T readNext();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I thought it&#39;s so interesting that I wrote an entire blog post about it.</p></section>
    <section id="section-2"><p>The comment at the top links to some stackoverflow post and has a feel of somebody who tried to pick the best abstraction for something the webapp does a lot - iterate through a file and close it afterwards.</p>

<p>You&#39;d want to use it like that:</p>

<pre><code>ObjectInputStream&lt;T&gt; stream =  new ...
T t;
while(t=stream.readNext()!=null){
  process(t);
}
stream.close();
</code></pre>

<p>Of course that doesn&#39;t play nicely with exceptions that might interrupt the execution - and then the stream won&#39;t be closed, oh dear. The old Java way is to put the <code>stream.close()</code> in the finally block,  and Java 7 lets you &quot;try with resources&quot; and both of these are already quite a rigid structure your code has to have: a while block within a try block.</p>

<p>I&#39;d much prefer to ignore the exceptions. We&#39;re putting the webapp on its own VM, mounted the filesystem all right, surely if the app starts to have problems with opening and reading through files it&#39;s not a problem it can solve by itself. Java&#39;s type system won&#39;t let me do that without polluting the type signature of the method: part of being <code>java.io.Closeable</code> means you&#39;re going to throw <code>IOException</code>s. A stronger version of these semantics is being <code>java.io.AutoCloseable</code> where <code>close()</code> throws an <code>Exception</code> which is meant to really encourage a try-with-resources block.</p>

<p>At some point someone in the project made an <a href="https://github.com/gxa/atlas/blob/master/base/src/main/java/uk/ac/ebi/atlas/profiles/IterableObjectInputStream.java">adapter</a> that turns an <code>ObjectInputStream&lt;T&gt;</code> into an <code>Iterable&lt;T&gt;</code>. Feel free to think how you&#39;d do it - you have a <code>readNext()</code>  which returns a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_value">sentinel value</a> of <code>null</code>  when there&#39;s no more to read, and you need to provide a <code>hasNext()</code> and <code>next()</code>.</p>

<p>OH NO DID YOU FORGET THE <code>close()</code>! Well we did at first - or maybe not becuse the adapter was originally for something that didn&#39;t actually require closing. I used it when rewriting the backend for our experiment page, and caused a resource leak that made it through test but after the release the webapp eventually ran out of file handles to hog.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s all solved - the stream will be closed after you iterate until the end, and you can
<code>
for(T t = new IterableObjectInputStream&lt;&gt;(openStream())){
process(t);
}
</code>
If you do <code>new IterableObjectInputStream&lt;&gt;(openStream()).iterator().next()</code> there will still be a leak but there&#39;s a comment at the top of the class that warns you to not do it.</p>

<p>We started with one constraint that can&#39;t be expressed through Java&#39;s type system - an object that needs <code>close()</code> called on it at least once - and swapped it for a second one, a collection that once instantiated must be traversed fully.  Java 8 introduces <code>java.util.stream</code> which is AutoCloseable - and it is different still, the programmer is meant to know whether or not they should put it in the try-with-resources block.</p>

<p>The possibility of somebody forgetting to close a file handle comes with Java just like memory leaks are possible in C. <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/05/11/making-wrong-code-look-wrong/">You can guard against it with convention and high professional standards</a>, and Java&#39;s checked exceptions try to nudge you towards the right thing, but in a way that is crude and often inappropriate. For some projects it&#39;s appropriate to write them in a language with a stronger type system that will make many mistakes impossible since all your file handles will be damn sure closed because you&#39;ll only be able to use them in a tiny main() method at the end of your program. Sometimes you want to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~uri/File-Slurp-9999.19/lib/File/Slurp.pm">read the file into one large string</a> and use a language that will only tell you &quot;oh this is so naughty go ahead&quot;. A yet different language makes it <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#with">very convenient to close your file handles</a>, and is sternly clear that this is what you should be doing.</p>

<p><i>
The Tao gave birth to machine language. Machine language gave birth to the assembler.</i></p>

<p>The assembler gave birth to the compiler. Now there are ten thousand languages.</p>

<p>Each language has its purpose, however humble. Each language expresses the Yin and Yang of software. Each language has its place within the Tao.</p>

<p>But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.  </p>
