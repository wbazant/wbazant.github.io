title: How to recognise misinformation online
---

I've been on a bit of an Internet trip this evening, after watching a TED talk by someone who left a profitable career in finance to "inspire millions online" by becoming a podcaster.

He spoke about having confidence to follow your passions, initial difficulties, and the journey he took, as well as his goal of creating a place on the Internet with long form talks and interesting conversations. I went to check it out and you can indeed benefit a lot by studying the content he created.

The site looked really solid at the beginning: just links and videos. When I clicked on one of the videos, it made me give an email address before I could watch it. Strange, huh?

Then I realised that the guests are all kinds of gurus: sexual energy healers, business coaches, conspiracy theorists. The deal seems to be that he gives them an easy interview and an audience.

Here is the podcast host, manly and inspiring, looking like someone who might help you figure out how to improve yourself:

I wanted to listen to someone sane so I clicked on a video with Wim Hof, the cold temperatures guru. Wim is in certain ways a real deal - he can really endure great cold:

Wim described those studies that are being done on him, what he thinks cold does to the body, and so on. He later talks about his two year old son, and what he thinks is important in life. A good guy!


I have then switched to a considerably more objectionable interviewee - David Icke, a conspiracy theorist infamous for absurd claims like climate change denial, in a special COVID-19 episode:

The host did a little disclaimer at the beginning, but otherwise didn't challenge Icke in any way, and just let him speak, as he explained his theory for coronavirus being a hoax:

1. hospitals give tests for a broad range of symptoms since doctors are convinced COVID-19 is a real disease
2. the tests report something that people have in their lungs anyway
3. fear and panic is responsible for more people getting sick and the increased death rate

It goes on, and there's eventually something about 5G.

Icke is a really credible speaker because he's calm, acts like a professor, and speaks with authority, but fundamentally the content is completely genius. I don't believe he is just crazy, what he's doing is too methodical and organised. There are outlines of chains of events, incomplete and with some parts are highlighted as really important, after which there are scientific explanations, mixed in with challenges of the official narrative, and so on. 

I wanted to continue researching the site, so I've left Icke before understanding how 5G networks are able to poison us, and went to listen to Jordan Belfort, a former finance fraudster who had Martin Scorcese make a movie about him:

It was just two men with very similar backgrounds sharing stories and helping each other look good. For example they discussed their past unhealthy attitudes to acquiring money, and how their current attitudes are much better. 

Belfort seemed really hopeful people will believe he's now a good guy, and said that while the movie was accurate in some ways, it simplified many things. His words: they never outright talked about ripping people off.

# Is this free speech?
The podcaster claims to support free speech by giving platform to surpressed voices. Before letting Icke disinform people about the coronavirus, he said a few of such things and recited how "he may disapprove of what Icke might say, but he will defend to the death Icke's right to say it".

I disagree hugely, and anyway, none of the podcaster's guests are suppressed. They have websites, popular social media accounts, and sell books on Amazon. I wish it was a bit more difficult to run a business based on deceiving people, but unfortunately, it is incredibly prevalent:

- sausages sell with pictures of healthy, meadow-roaming animals
- fashion brands impose unrealistic beauty standards and body types
- jewellers and florists gain customers by convincing people that their loved ones expect affection expressed through purchases of pretty objects 

I am not sure if David Icke is doing something fundamentally different. Sure, his product is just his lies, whereas companies also sell physical products in addition to their lies, but would it make any difference if Icke presented his nonsense in short, attractive bursts on primetime TV, and his books came with a roll of tinfoil? 

# Where is the link?
Screenshots were moshed with [PHOTOMOSH](https://photomosh.com/). Until convinced otherwise, I would prefer not to say what the podcaster's name is, or link to his website here. If you know who he is, tell me and I'll be very impressed with your knowledge of the internet!

For now, if you must have a link, please have this different link instead:
