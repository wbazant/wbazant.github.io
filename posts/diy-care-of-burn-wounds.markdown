title: DIY care of burn wounds
---

On an evening of a fourth of February, I have sustained a scald burn injury from spilling hot tea on myself. It's okay now, and I'm not sure whether I have learned much from it, but maybe a bit, and I didn't even go to a doctor. Dear reader, I want to tell you about my journey so that you too can become wiser, and at a much smaller expense.

# On the day
I was sitting in the living room of the house I live in, reading a book and drinking tea, when a glitch in the Matrix happened and my brain paused for a little while. I've loosened the grip on the cup, spilt its hot contents on my arm and body, and screamed.
The lady who owns the house also lives here with her daughter, and she heard the scream, and called the daughter's name worried. I've shouted back that it was okay - I just spilt tea on myself - and that I'm sorry.
I have went to the kitchen to pick up a cloth, and dried the sofa a bit while in pain, and then I went back to my room to check what happened to me. There was more pain as I took my jumper off, and a lot of my body was red, so I kind of panicked.

# Description of the injured area
The small part where the tea initially poured on was probably burnt to a second degree because it had bubbles and stuff, and a further area that was about as big as a palm of my hand had a terrible shade of red. The skin on my stomach wasn't damaged permanently.

# Immediate treatment
I remembered pouring water over scalds brings relief so I went to the bathroom, put my injured arm under flowing cold water, and searched what to do on my phone. Stuff wasn't reassuring I've found confirmation that the cold water idea is good, so I went into a shower. It kind of brought relief from the pain.

Then I don't remember exactly but I've put cling foil from the kitchen over my arm and went to bed - it was about 8 pm - and there I was putting up with the pain and read more. I was trying to diagnose myself and how bad my burn is, what the treatment is (not get the arm infected, the cling foil is a tip for that) and whether to go to a doctor. I had insurance from work but haven't really used it or set it up so I didn't really know how I would see a doctor. I only kind of knew that doctors are expensive in the US and that I can go to emergency treatment in a hospital if it's really bad, but I didn't.

I've kept reading about burns and treatments while miserable, hurt and lonely. At maybe 10 pm I have realised I'm in much less pain already, and went to sleep with that cling foil around the arm.

# Next day when I went to work
I've washed and put new foil on. Then I went to a cool 9 am meeting, sat through it, and asked a colleague if they went to a pharmacy nearby. I think the request made them uncomfortable, they said they haven't and that they're not actually from Philly. Another colleague I've asked hasn't either but they seemed to want to help me, and they started to search for them online. So I went to CVS.

I tried to get some free medical advice at the CVS by asking a person in the pharmacy counter about stuff for burn wounds, they went with me to the shelf that had them, and pointed at a random thing. I asked if they have medical education and know what these drugs do, but they said that "this stuff is for burns" and walked away.

I bought a bandage, a box of gauzes, and a cream with antibiotics, all for maybe 20 dollars. I came back, applied cream and a gauze in the bathroom, and came back to the office with the bandage to get tape and scissors. Another colleague checked on me with concern - up until this point there was no sign of me being injured and now I was trying to wrap a bandage one handed - and wrapped the bandage for me, which made me feel very grateful. I mostly didn't disrupt the office quiet at all, most people didn't look or ask.

There's this part of the Fight Club movie where the main character comes in to work with a bloody, messed up face, and nobody acknowledges it, even as they ask him how his weekend was, and other small talk questions. It was a bit like that partially, but other people showed me concern and care. 

A final observation about this day is that I wore an exercise tracksuit top that was looser than the jumpers I tend to wear. I felt very self-conscious and low-status about it, and it made me extra uncomfortable in social interactions fo the whole day. Who knows where within me this feeling comes from!

# Ongoing care
Twice a day, I washed the wound area, and put a new layer of cream on, covered with a gauze, and tied the bandage around. I've started from using a new piece of bandage each time, to the same bandage, and also learned how to tie it up so that it doesn't slip off the arm.

Two days in my cream got an upgrade: a person I know from work got burned a few months ago, by spilling pot contents on themselves why cooking. They shared a silver-based cream from their prescription with me, as well as what happened when they went to the doctor: they waited, then they got help and paid 60 dollars.

At some point my housemate, a medical student, took a look at it as well, and reassured me that it already healed quite well.

I also took pictures to be able to track whether it's healing ot not. After a week, I stopped the cream and gauze parts, and soon after also the bandage. A month later, it's almost gone almost completely: you have to look really carefully to see a somewhat darker patch.

# Gratitude 
I am grateful to:
- the internet, for all the advice, much of it from volunteer-powered sources like Wikipedia
- the lady who owns the house for providing cling foil for house use
- our family business who makes the nice jumpers I get to wear
- my colleague who googled where the nearest pharmacy was and encouraged me to go there
- to the pharmacy itself, for being there to profit from my needs and employing someone who knew which shelf the stuff for wounds is on

# Learnings

In case another bad thing happens to me later, I've learned about the American medical system and I registered with a primary care doctor. In case of my fear of spending again interfering with good decisions, it will be helpful for me to know what the prices actually are, for something that doesn't involve hospital stay: 25 bucks at usual speed, and 50 bucks in urgent mode.

I still don't know that much about wounds, but I think I've diagnosed and treated this wound successfully with all the help I got: I didn't get it infected, managed the discomfort, didn't do something stupid that made the injury worse or leave me with a scar.

In a way, I got the opposite of an experience of going to a faith healer or a herbalist. I had all the facts available that let me judge how bad my burn was, and access to evidence based medicine, but it felt very lonely to not have anyone give me a procedure to follow along with a bit of magic dust.

The organisation of care such that everyone is being cared for seems like a really critical thing our society should be doing, and if someone out there has ideas about how this could happen, I would definitely be interested in helping them bring about their implementation!
