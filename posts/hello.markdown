Welcome to my blog! The posts are shamelessly backdated, including this one. I originally wanted to make this around late 2016, wrote some drafts, forgot about it for a while, and the initial publication was mid-2018. Since then, it's been a roaring success, and as of last week I can say I'm negotiating a book deal.

It's going to be mostly about programming but I might post my banana pancake recipe here, too. And of course it's not all gonna be lies but there will be some lies.
