title: Identifying flaws in radical comics
---

The Internet is full of confusing content made by passionate people that, for this reason or another, have a different worldview from yours. Don't worry, these people are all wrong. This post will teach you how to identify flaws in their reasoning.

# On fallacies
There are two classes of errors that could have been made by people who don't think like you. Either their premises are incorrect - they would have made an [informal error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy#Informal_fallacy) - or their reasoning is, i.e. a [formal error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy).

For simplicity, we will ignore the possibility that a flawed comic still makes a correct observation. This can sometimes happen, and claiming something is false because it's been incorrectly argued is known as a ["fallacy fallacy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy). This nuance is not of interest to us here, because we already know the author is wrong, and once you recognise a flaw in a disagreeable comic, any nagging feelings it might create is bound to go away.

# Ad hominem: Batman on poverty
Some behaviours really don't belong in a civilised discussion:

Slapping someone across the face because you can't refute their claim is a typical ad hominem.

# Strawman: CEO pay
A common criticism of capitalism is that it creates inequalities, and high salaries drawn by executives of publicly traded companies is a frequently quoted example:

**To understand why this is a strawman, one has to understand a little economics.** CEOs are rewarded because they create value for the shareholders of the companies they lead - not because of their hard work or any particular quantity, indeed I believe that the shareholders frequently aren't sure what they reward when they approve the CEOs' decisions on their own pay. It doesn't matter how questionable such decisions might be - if it's a bad one, the company will do less well or right out go out of business, and the capital will shift somewhere else.

# False dichotomy: "Success story" by Billy Burg
I really don't like this comic, it's so preachy. Two old-time friends catch up over coffee, one - named Margaret - is proud of the job she does, the other one, Beatrice, doesn't want to talk about hers very much. See for yourself:

If I understand correctly, Beatrice is rejecting the notion that what she has just described to Margaret are her hobbies, as a way to state that she really cares about those unproductive activities she does in her free time. This is incorrect since you can both have a hobby, and profit from it.

# Non sequitur: "Nietzsche tries speed dating" by Existential Comics

This was the last one. I hope you've enjoyed the post!
