    <section id="section-1"><p>I&#39;m glad the title caught your attention. Why call R from Perl - or have code in language X call code for language Y, for any X and Y, for that matter? Sometimes it&#39;s just hard to choose among languages you&#39;re fluent in, especially if you&#39;re a bit of a polyglot and don&#39;t have a clear favourite. Perhaps you value diversity, just like modern companies value diversity in their workforce: different programming languages, just like employees with different backgrounds, offer distinct advantages and strengths that can be drawn from when creating a product.</p>

<p>I happen to have a language I strongly favour, and I consider my programs are already diverse enough, even though they all got written by a single white male. I also managed to have a job in bioinformatics without installing R for quite a while. I am not riding that streak any more because a specific thing I needed to do only exists as an R package, so I learned how to use R from Perl. This merits celebration with a blog post, so I&#39;m gonna tell you how to call R from Perl and also more generally about IPC.</p></section>
    <section id="section-2"><h2>The answer to the original question</h2>

<p>Just use a library, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Statistics::R">Statistics::R</a>. The code that prompted the post is <a href="https://github.com/WormBase/wbps-expression/blob/master/lib/Production/Analysis/DESeq2.pm">here</a>, but the interesting part is how Statistics::R works. It starts R - getting the executable from <code>path</code> like it should - in a subprocess to which it talks through STDIN and STDOUT. It&#39;s easy to get and set scalars and arrays between the languages, though not e.g. R&#39;s data frames.</p>

<h2>Ways of IPC</h2>

<p>Different ways, and their different complexity, is best explained by means of a meme:</p>

<p><img src="/static/expanding-brain-ipc.png"></p>

<p>As the brain expands, the ways get more elaborate and stupid. Yes, more stupid - the whole idea of calling languageX from language Y is backwards and outdated, and if you want to keep your skillset modern I advise you avoid IPC and stick to microservices. Microservices are slick and simple, you just need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>create separate isolated environments for X and Y: I&#39;ve heard Docker is good</li>
<li>have a program that automatically rents machines on the cloud for you: I&#39;ve heard Terraform is good</li>
<li>have a program that installs stuff on machines, and prepares your environments there: I&#39;ve heard Ansible is good</li>
<li>have a program that launches and runs processes in these environments: I&#39;ve heard Kubernetes is good</li>
<li>let your processes talk to each other via HTTP: this requires that they&#39;re connected by a network - if you&#39;re concerned about security, I&#39;ve heard that subnets are good</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not require a fleet of rented VMs, just pretend you do. Run Kubernetes locally via something called <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/">Minikube</a>.</p>

<h2>Temporary files</h2>

<p>An old method of sending messages is through temporary files: a writing party stores them in a pre-agreed place that the recipient periodically checks. This is worth a try in a work setting, when you need to share intermediate results with another group: instead of promising you&#39;ll email someone when you&#39;re done, tell them you&#39;ll leave them a file in a certain place and suggest they set up a cron job.</p>

<p>You can use a similar scheme when co-ordinating two processes. By convention they should use STDIN/STDOUT, but you can also refer to a file system path in both the writer and the reader. This works nicely when the two processes run the same program, like with lock files.</p>

<h2>Run a process, let it finish, capture STDOUT</h2>

<p>&quot;Shelling out&quot; is a bit like using temporary files. Some communication happens in it, I can&#39;t really decide whether it&#39;s more or less advanced than using temporary files. It is accomplished via backticks in Perl:</p>

<pre><code># LOL terrible code don&#39;t do this
print for `ls`;
</code></pre>

<p>The process with your main program is a <strike>master</strike> leader, asks the OS for a temporary file handle and to start a process with an appropriate follower whose STDOUT will go to that file handle. The follower <strike>does its job</strike> performs their role and goes to rest. </p>

<h2>Pipes</h2>

<p>Shelling out will wait for the worker to finish, but when connected via pipe the worker will be put on hold as you read at your own pace. It&#39;s good, I do recommend.</p>

<p>If you start a worker controlling both its STDIN and STDOUT you can talk with it back and forth: this is how Statistics::R works. Twigging this was really helpful in understanding how I should pass data from R - it explained why I could only get stuff in at most one-dimensional data structures, i.e. vectors.</p>

<h2>Shared memory</h2>

<p>Ah, yes, the brain is expanding. You don&#39;t need pipes - the forty year old mechanism to orchestrate IPC by stopping your processes, batching the input and more - because you can do better. Here&#39;s your playground - give your processes some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmap">shared memory</a> and make them read and write to the same area. If you wanna learn how to do that, you need to read some other blog because I have no idea. </p>

<p>What I do know is that reading arbitrary memory contents is well-supported by Perl, through <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/pack.html">packing</a> and <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/unpack.html">unpacking</a> bytes, which could be an array of C structs laid out one after another. There&#39;s a little domain specific language for packing - if you ever need to format something to be 80 characters wide, do find out about it.</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p>Just do what you need to do. If you end up with Python calling Bash calling R calling Java, and the whole thing still works, it is a sign of high DevOps skill, and will be helpful when you try get a promotion to a Senior DevOps. Sketch some diagrams, call your program a pipeline, and then put it in a Docker container. I&#39;ve heard Kubernetes is good for managing these.</p>
