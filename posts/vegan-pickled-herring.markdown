title: Vegan pickled herring
---

This is my new aubergine/eggplant recipe, inspired by baba ganoush and the fact I had one spare eggplant, a free evening, and a need to invent something for dinner.

If you're inspired by elaborate, and largely ineffective, cooking processes, this is a post for you!

# Ingredients
- eggplant
- garlic
- coriander leaves
- olive oil
- optional: other baba ganoush ingredients
- vinegar

# Preparation
Slice the eggplant into thin flat pieces, rub salt on both sides of each piece, and leave in a bowl. This will get the juice out, removing the bitterness.

Chop garlic and coriander, and put to the side.

Come back to the eggplant after about twenty minutes, and rub off the moisture and excess salt with a paper towel. Remove skins, and cut the inside into batonnets, by which I mean, pieces thicker than juliennes in the french cut.

Pan fry the pieces on a hot pan - baba ganoush recipes want the eggplant charred on a grill, so we're trying to simulate that a bit, also removing more moisture.

When the eggplant is almost ready, add generous olive oil, garlic, and coriander. This is a questionable move, because herbs lose their flavour when heated, but coriander is kind of stubborn, so just be quick. At this point the eggplant won't be totally ready because pan frying isn't very effective, and you'll still have to combine it with garlic and oil, which is a justification for dropping it all in.

Finally, add vinegar - we're sorted for salt, fat, and heat, and there's no lemon in the kitchen, so vinegar will take care of the missing acidity dimension. The vinegar will synergise with the fried aubergine's general sliminess and the dish's oiliness, and make it remarkably similar to pickled herring.

Serve on toast, on a plate with toast to the side, or without toast.
