title: Polenta on toast
---
My new friends in Philly have acquired a lot of just-ready-for-use milk, and gave me a carton. I've decided to make cheese from it, saved up the whey, and I've used it to make my best polenta ever. My next genius move was to put it on toast, which created a nice contrast between the softness and the hardness.

# Cheese
If you have milk, you can also have ricotta-style cheese. Add salt, heat it up until it's frothing, then take it off and add an acid. Then let it be for a while: the proteins will denaturate, form curds, and leave whey behind.

It's easy to experiment with: you need to create conditions for proteins to denaturate, which can be achieved by the combination of salt, acid, heat, and optionally enzymes.

# Polenta
Coarse milled corn flour is a rather magical ingredient due to its ability to thicken things. It also has its own flavour, so every time you thicken a thing with it you imbue it with polenta-essence. Choose wisely what to thicken, and you will make very good polenta.

## Example polentas

### Fried polenta
Make too much polenta, and leave it in the fridge for a while for it to solidify. Cut into rectangles, and fry them.

### Polenta with whey
Instead of water, use whey. You'll get something nice and creamy.

### Thickened sauce
If the sauce didn't come out right, you can add a bit of corn flour to make it into a polenta version of itself.

# Putting things on toast
This is frequently a strong move, if you regularly have a fridge full of frozen sourdough like I do. Be open-minded about what can go with your toast, and between having a dish vanilla, with toast on the side, and the always-appealing dish-on-toast you'll be able to triple the amount of dishes you can cook.

If you're not sure where to take good bread from, I suggest you read some Kropotkin.

# Cooking more generally
Cooking is the bridge between farming and feeding. It consists of processes that each require an input, and yield either a plate full of lovingly prepared food, or one or more partial products. Everyone needs a stream of feeding services, so you need someone to cook for you.
