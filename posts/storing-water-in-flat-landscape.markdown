title: Storing water in a flat landscape
---

The climate is changing, which may be detrimental to the long-term future of your garden. You should begin to prepare for the increased variance in weather: abnormally warm or cold seasons, longer dry spells, more violent rains. I wouldn't worry about the total increase of temperature, if you live in temparate zones - it is predicted to be a mere few degrees over the next few decades, and your plants will probably enjoy it.

The largest climate-induced risk to your garden is probably potential breakdown of society in areas worse off than yours. I suggest you leave the resulting massive wave of migration to your government, which will probably sort out a nice border fence, and focus on things you can do something about.

So, let's learn about storing water.

## Background
Plants need a more or less continuous access to water in their roots, and the main way they lose it is by evaporation through their stomata - tiny holes at the bottoms of their leaves that are open when the plant takes up air for photosynthesis. The plants pull water up from a layer of topsoil that's as deep as their roots can reach. 

This stops when the soil's moisture is down to a certain minimal level where all H20 particles are bound to grains of mineral and are not available to the root. The plant can store a bit of water in its cell walls, but not much, and when it gets depleted the plant goes limp.

So, here's a simplification: water enters the system during condensation and when it rains, infiltrates, and then goes away at some rate. The system keeps functioning until the levels drop too low for too long. If it doesn't fail for the whole summer, you will enjoy a sweet harvest and won't have to rely on supermarkets.

## Stuff that I think doesn't work
### Improving on rainfall
Don't try and make it rain more, especially by making up for insufficient rain with drinking water. In my eyes it is a symbol of insufficient cunning and therefore of low status to have a lawn that only survives because it is being watered.

### Improving infiltration
I think there's not much to improve about infiltration in a "slightly too dry" terrain without a slope. You can dig a ditch on contour if you have a slope, and if puddles form and then evaporate your soil is probably full of clay, and you could try mix in some sand. I do not get puddles in my garden during the summer, so I think pretty much all the water that falls on the ground makes it in.

### Reducing loss

#### Weeding
You can remove competing plants from an area - this is professionally called raking, but honestly it's a bit of a beginner move and those other plants might actually be good. "Weed" is, after all, a slur.

 I've begun to look up plants growing in my patch before removing them if I don't know what they are. This is how I've learned about [Canada goldenrods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidago_canadensis), and now see them everywhere - the FedEx arrow of the Polish plant world.

#### Mulching
You can reduce evaporation by keeping the soil covered, which also makes for less weeding. You can mulch with shredded leaves, straw, compost, or woodchip. You can even use a thick sheet of plastic, or a large chunk of felt.

#### Other methods
Do email me if I'm missing something!

## Benefits of improving storage capacity
The storage capacity depends on the composition of the soil: it's better when the particles are finer, and when there is more organic material. So you could build a large pile of organic material, and grow in that. Aim for this effect:

It's a big pile of rotting stuff that we drag there from all over our yard: cut grass, branches, leaves. We used to ritually set it on fire, but in April 2019, I've planted butternut squash in it instead. It did very well and there are about seven of these beauties:

It was very sunny and warm this summer with some two ten day long spells of no precipitation in June and late August. You can see it was getting close because a few leaves went yellow, but the plant survived with no watering. There was no effort in looking after it, but I frequently go to that area of the garden and admire it proudly.

We liked the scheme so much that we're starting more piles:

## Start your own
Building piles of wood and soil is called hugelkultur and you can learn about it on the Internet.

I've found it hard to learn about it at first, as it is so unscientific. There are many blogs with words like "hugelkultur" and inspiring photos, but nobody ever explains how long you need to wait until your pile of wood becomes something more.

One way forward is to only follow advice of people who were clearly successful permaculturalists. I believe my squash is more than enough of a success, but if you need a second opinion be sure to check out this book by Sepp Holzer: [Permaculture: A Practical Guide to Small-Scale, Integrative Farming and Gardening](http://www.leotiger.com/omg/sepp.pdf). It is currently hosted by someone who probably has publisher's permission to do it, but if if disappears, email me and I'll lend you my copy.
