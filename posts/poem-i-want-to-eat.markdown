title: My first vegan poem
---

I've joined a poetry group. There are prompts, people work on them, and afterwards read them in pairs.


---

People are super creative there. To a prompt a window we once looked through, my pair wrote a haiku where they complained about bad views from all the apartments they lived in. People bring up weird experiences, their friends, the poems have all kinds of vibes to them.


I kind of tried to make my poems have form and rhyme at the expense of actual content. People said they liked that they rhymed, but there wasn't much to them. Final prompt was about the kitchen table and a visitor there, and I remembered a "I'm having a friend for dinner" from the Hannibal movie. So I decided to write a vegan version:


<i>
I've brought a bag of friends over for dinner:

fleshy tomatoes, perky paprika, nice herbs.

I'm making pasta, and I will eat them all.


It's cool we have community gardens,

free food, and all our ideals -

but at the end of the day, I want to eat.
