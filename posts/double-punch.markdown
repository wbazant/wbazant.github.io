title: Double punch techniques in cooking
---

Knowing martial arts can turn out to be useful in life. In this post, I will explain how to apply the technique of double punch in your everyday fights against inadequate nutrition.

# Introduction to double punches
While most striking techniques involve deploying a single limb at a time, some have you use two, letting you make sure your opponent will be totally vanquished. Karate has a number of those, for example the fearsome awase-tsuki, consisting of a simultaneous mountain punch and a sucker punch:

# Techniques

## While baking bread, stick a whole aubergine into the oven
Aubergines, known abroad as eggplants, take a long time to bake, but not as long as bread does. Toss a whole aubergine into the oven while you're baking bread, and it's gonna be soft and mushy just in time. Take both the bread and the aubergine out, and while the bread cools, mix the soft aubergine insides with tahini and lemon for a fantastic dip known as baba ganoush.

## While boiling pasta also hard boil an egg
This tip comes from my housemate Steven, and I haven't tried it yet. There is no obvious synergy between pasta and hardboiled eggs, but there's no harm boiling them together either, and you can eat the egg later.

## Keep squash seeds, then panfry them for a snack
Squash and pumpkin seeds are delicious, and you can have them with afternoon coffee while you ruminate on the fantastic dish you made with that squash earlier.

## Keep chickpea water for baking
Chickpeas are known abroad as garbanzo beans. Water from boiling them can be used as a binder like you would otherwise use eggs. The furthest I got on applying this tip was to save the water, but then I did nothing with it for a week, so I am yet to report on what this is like.

## Preserve the whey after cheesemaking
Making cheese is a good way to use an occasional vast surplus of milk. A local community cooking group I am sometimes involved in gets milk from supermarket donations, and later can not use them, which is how I sometimes have a surplus. I'm not sure how else you can end up with an occasional vast surplus of milk. Perhaps if own a timeshare in a cow that gets rotated between a few families, and it's your family's turn this week? 

Anyway, after you make cheese, there's lots of whey left over, and some of it can be sent to the freezer and be occasionally taken out. I've been making porridge on whey, pancakes on whey, I pickled carrots in whey, and I experimented with having whey straight down, which is not super enjoyable but otherwise very refreshing.

## Use leftover bits of veggies for stock
If you've been having a community cooking session in which you've been peeling and cutting parts of veggies - onion, carrot, celery - and just dumped everything into compost, you can then pick through that compost and reclaim various non-rotten parts into a pot. Simmer it gently for a while, and you will get very good stock. This is where I think we get stock from, but I don't actually know who does it, it just gets pulled out when we need it.

This technique of reclaiming veggie peels was also done in a French restaurant my housemate once worked in, with the stock prepared overnight, and it's a good example how larger scale of cooking can be less wasteful.

# Other applications of double punch
Double punch techniques can also be used in gardening, when you use the same pot to simultaneously grow two plants that are different enough in their needs that they won't compete with each other. For example, today I've stuck a sprouted potato into a pot with young radishes.

# Other martial arts techniques applicable to cooking
After raising a knee, a martial artist can perform a front kick, a hook, or a roundhouse, without giving their intentions away to the opponent. It can also be performed without fully committing which technique they will be developed into. Similarly, you can take out a bunch of veggies from the fridge and start chopping them up, not yet having decided on a concrete dish.

There is also an equivalent of the legendary Five Point Palm Exploding Heart technique, where you deep fry five different dishes - potato chips, onion rings, carrots, the fourth dish that I need to keep secret to reduce potential damage done by my posts, and a chocolate bar - that when eaten regularly and combined with taking no more than five steps a day leads to terrible heart disease complications. Unfortunately I can not teach it publicly, to preserve the good image of meat-free cooking. Stay well, and if would like to be taught know how to deep fry, feel free reach out to me over an encrypted channel!
