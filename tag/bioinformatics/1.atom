            <p>There is a belief, especially popular under university graduates with heads full of Noam Chomsky, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy">in the inherent hierarchy of grammars</a>, and there are people out there who think it's something that has to be followed. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454">Obey the hierarchy, they tell you</a>. I suggest you hear them out, learn what is there to be learned, and then reply, I didn't know there were any rules about this. Dear reader, you are my fellow human and I want you to be strong and empowered. I'm gonna show you how to parse XML with regular expressions, and then you can make your own choices.</p>

            <p>This is going to be an introduction for programmers who don't know much bioinformatics, pretty much me before I started working on <a href="http://parasite.wormbase.org">WormBase ParaSite</a>. For something less ignorant, simplistic, and without swearwords, you could read <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11433356">Genome annotation: from sequence to biology (2001)</a>. </p>
