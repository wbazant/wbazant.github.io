            <p>I learned the recipe from my parents, who learned it from their parents. I enjoy the dish regularly when apples are in season. Apples are in season from August to first frosts. In this post I will also tell you how I figured out the bit of context to the dish I was missing as a child, namely its suitedness to country-wide poverty and institutional disfunction that must have been reality for my grandparents and everyone they knew. I will conclude with musings on a 'cheap dish for bad times', an alternate title I was toying with, but first I will tell you how to make the damn thing which I think should be standard convention for food blogs.</p>

            <p>I have made a very successful cooking experiment today, and managed to confirm the validity of a novel technique in leftover management that I have devised also today, but slightly earlier. This post won't quite touch upon whether any idea can be truly new, but it will hopefully still teach you something.</p>
