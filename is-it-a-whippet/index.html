<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The whippet is a dog breed of medium size. The name is derived from an early 17th-century word, meaning "to move briskly".</p>

<h2>Do whippets really move briskly?</h2>

<p>Only occasionally.</p>

<p>Here is a stationary whippet:</p>

<p>Here is a whippet that moves slowly, and to a very small extent:</p>

<p>This whippet moves rather quickly, but not entirely on their own:

<p>We could say that whippets move at a speed in an appropriate response to their surroundings.</p>

<h2>Special abilities</h2>

<h3>Trick jumping</h3>

<p>Whippets can jump, then spread themselves flat in the air, fold back up, and finally land safely at the same spot:

<p>No one knows how they have learned to do this, and what advantages it may give them.</p>

<h3>Excellent sight</h3>

<p>Whippets, being sighthounds, have an impressive ability to see each other across a large distance. This whippet is exchanging glances with another whippet on the other side of an expansive valley:

<h2>Preferred environment</h2>

<p>Whippets are diurnal, but they spend their days much like nocturnal animals, which in conjunction makes them very well adapted to indoor environments.</p>

<p>Here is a whippet in their preferred environment:

<h2>Comparison with greyhounds</h2>

<p>Whippets are slightly smaller than greyhounds.</p>

<p>A young greyhound could be mistaken for a whippet, just like a young whippet could be mistaken for an even younger greyhound.</p>

<h2>Comparison with other dogs</h2>

<p>Since all dogs are good, there is generally no need for comparisons between them.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Whippets are beautiful animals, but the complexity of their behaviour is only partially understood. Since they aren't all the same - and are in fact all different - it is worth to engage in conversations with caretakers of whippets. It is best to ask the animal's caretaker. "Is it a whippet?" is frequently a great conversation starter.</p>
