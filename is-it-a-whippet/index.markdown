## Introduction
The whippet is a dog breed of medium size. The name is derived from an early 17th-century word, meaning "to move briskly".

## Do whippets really move briskly?
Only occasionally.

Here is a stationary whippet:

Here is a whippet that moves slowly, and to a very small extent:

This whippet moves rather quickly, but not entirely on their own:

We could say that whippets move at a speed in an appropriate response to their surroundings.

## Special abilities
### Trick jumping
Whippets can jump, then spread themselves flat in the air, fold back up, and finally land safely at the same spot:

No one knows how they have learned to do this, and what advantages it may give them.

### Excellent sight
Whippets, being sighthounds, an have impressive ability to see each other across a large distance. This whippet is exchanging glances with another whippet on the other side of an expansive valley:

## Preferred environment

Whippets are diurnal, but they spend their days much like nocturnal animals, which in conjunction makes them very well adapted to indoor environments.

Here is a whippet in their preferred environment:

## Comparison with greyhounds
Whippets are slightly smaller than greyhounds.

A young greyhound could be mistaken for a whippet, just like a young whippet could be mistaken for an even younger greyhound.

## Comparison with other dogs
Since all dogs are good, there is generally no need for comparisons between them.

## Summary
Whippets are beautiful animals, but the complexity of their behaviour is only partially understood. Since they aren't all the same - and are in fact all different - it is worth to engage in conversations with caretakers of whippets. It is best to ask the animal's caretaker. "Is it a whippet?" is frequently a great conversation starter.
